Description : Retail Dataset Featuring Bikes, Accessories, Clothing Sales, and Customer Orders.

Insights: The business serves 18,484 customers who placed a total of 27,659 orders, resulting in over $29 million in sales.
           Bikes stand out as the most popular and profitable products, generating the highest revenue with an average price of $949.
           Most sales come from the United States, followed by Australia and Canada, reflecting strong market demand across regions.
           Despite impressive sales, profits remain minimal, as total sales and total costs are nearly equal â€“ highlighting an opportunity to optimise pricing and margins.
