# SQL WITH ANURAG
# Project 1: EXPLORATARY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
Description : Retail Dataset Featuring Bikes, Accessories, Clothing Sales, and Customer Orders.
Insights: The business serves 18,484 customers who placed a total of 27,659 orders, resulting in over $29 million in sales.
           Bikes stand out as the most popular and profitable products, generating the highest revenue with an average price of $949.
           Most sales come from the United States, followed by Australia and Canada, reflecting strong market demand across regions.
           Despite impressive sales, profits remain minimal, as total sales and total costs are nearly equal, highlighting an opportunity to optimise pricing and margins.

# Project 2: CUSTOMER REPORT 
This project showcases a customer focused business report built entirely in SQL, using advanced techniques like joins, CTEs, window functions, and case logic. It transforms raw sales data into actionable insights such as customer segmentation, total orders, sales, quantity, customer lifespan, recency, average order value, and monthly spend. The output serves as a foundation for Power BI or Tableau dashboards and is aimed at helping businesses understand customer behavior, optimise retention strategies, and support data-driven decision-making.
